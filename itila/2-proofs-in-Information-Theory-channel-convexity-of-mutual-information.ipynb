    "# 2 proofs in Information Theory: channel-convexity of mutual information"

    "I've been studying Information Theory lately, through David MacKay's excellent book [_Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms_](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/). In it, there's an elementary Information Theory result left as an uncorrected exercise ([Exercise 10.7](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itprnn/ps/161.173.pdf)), which could be phrased informally as: _the Mutual Information is a convex function of the channel parameters_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will give 2 proofs of this proposition: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first proof uses typical calculus tools, proving convexity by computing the Hessian and showing that it's positive semi-definite. \n",
    "* The second proof only uses information-theoretical arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second proof is shorter, clearer, more insightful, and more self-contained. The first proof is the first one I delivered; it is longer and more technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why write about the first proof at all? Because I see a few benefits to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It serves as a **cautionary tale** against always rushing to analytical methods, instead of searching for an insightful perspective on the problem.\n",
    "2. From a pedagogical standpoint, it serves as an occasion to demonstrate how some **classical tools from calculus and linear algebra** can be used together.\n",
    "3. If you're anything like me, you've always dreamt of knowing what the **Hessian of Mutual Information** looks like. (Come on, admit it.)"

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two finite sets $X$ and $Y$, a **discrete memoryless channel** is a specification of probability distributions $P(y | x)$, for $x \\in X$ and $y \\in Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, this notion is motivated as follows: a _sender_ chooses a message $x \\in X$ to send, which after going through the communication channel will result in a _receiver_ receiving some $y \\in Y$. In an ideal world, we would be certain of what $y$ would be received after sending $x$ (in other words, y would be a _function_ of $x$); but unfortunately, the channel adds random _noise_ to the signal, such that after having chosen to send $x$, we only know the _probability distribution_ $P(y | x)$ of what might be received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the channel consists of $|X|$ probability distributions over a set of $Y$ elements, the channel can be represented by an $|Y| \\times |X|$ **transition matrix** $Q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q_{yx} := P(y | x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each cell of $Q$ contains a values between 0 and 1, and the columns of Q sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume of probability distribution $P_X$ over $X$, a channel $Q$ gives us a probability distribution $P_Y$ of $Y$, by $P(y) = \\sum_{x}{P(y | x)P(x)}$. Representing $P_X$ and $P_Y$ as vectors, this relation can be written as a matrix multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_Y = Q P_X $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **mutual information** $I[X;Y]$ between $X$ and $Y$ represents the average amount of information about $X$ that is gained by learning $Y$; phrased differently, it is the amount of _uncertainty_ (**entropy**) about $X$ that goes away by learning $Y$. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I[X;Y] = H[X] - H[X | Y] = H[Y] - H[Y | X] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above formula, $H[X]$ is the **entropy** of random variable $X$, and $H[X | Y]$ is the **conditional entropy** of $X$ given $Y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H[Y] = \\sum_{y}{P(y) \\log(\\frac{1}{P(y)})} $$\n",
    "$$ H[Y | X] = \\sum_{x}{P(x) H[Y | X = x]} = \\sum_{x}{P(x) \\sum_{y}{P(y | x) \\log(\\frac{1}{P(y | x)})} } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we want to prove\n",
    "\n",
    "The result we want to prove is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a probability distribution over $X$, the function $I: Q \\mapsto I[X;Y]$ is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In details, this means that given 2 channels $Q^{(0)}$ and $Q^{(1)}$, and a weight $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, we can define a 'mixed' channel $Q^{(\\lambda)} := \\lambda Q^{(0)} + (1 - \\lambda)Q^{(1)}$, with the property that $I(Q^{(\\lambda)}) \\leq \\lambda I(Q^{(0)}) + (1 - \\lambda)I(Q^{(1)})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to the capacity of conveying information, mixing 2 channels is always worse than using the most informative of the 2 channels we started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, mixing 2 fully-deterministic channels (which are maximally informative) can result in a noisy channel!"

    "A common approach to proving that a function is convex is to differentiate it twice, yielding a Hessian matrix, and to prove that this Hessian is positive semidefinite. That's what we'll set out to do here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the Hessian\n",
    "\n",
    "$I(Q)$ can be viewed as a function of $|X| \\times |Y|$ variables, therefore our Hessian will be a square matrix containing $(|X||Y|)^2$ entries, of the form $\\frac{\\partial^2I}{\\partial Q_{yx} \\partial Q_{vu}}$.\n",

    "$$ \\frac{\\partial H[Y | X]}{\\partial Q_{vu}} = - \\pi_u (1 + \\log(Q_{vu}))$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proving the Hessian is positive semi-definite\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordering the indices $yx$ in lexicographic order, thanks to the $\\delta_{y=v}$ factor, we see that **the Hessian matrix has a block-diagonal layout**, with diagonal blocks $B^{(y)}$ of shape $|X| \\times |X|$. It is therefore **sufficient to prove that each diagonal block $B^{(y)}$ is positive semi-definite.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoting $\\Delta := \\text{diag}((\\frac{\\pi_x}{Q_{yx}})_{x \\in X})$, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B^{(y)} = \\Delta - \\frac{1}{\\rho_y}\\pi\\pi^\\top $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now prove that $B^{(y)}$ is positive semi-definite. Let $\\epsilon$ a vector; we want to prove $\\epsilon^\\top B^{(y)} \\epsilon \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\epsilon^\\top B^{(y)} \\epsilon = \\epsilon^\\top \\Delta \\epsilon - \\frac{1}{\\rho_y} (\\pi^\\top \\epsilon)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our goal becomes to prove:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\epsilon^\\top \\Delta \\epsilon  \\geq  \\frac{1}{\\rho_y} (\\pi^\\top \\epsilon)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Uparrow $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\pi^\\top \\epsilon)^2 \\leq \\rho_y (\\epsilon^\\top \\Delta \\epsilon)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Uparrow $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\big(\\sum_{x}{\\pi_x \\epsilon_x}\\big)^2  \\leq  \\big(\\sum_{x}{Q_{yx} \\pi_x}\\big) \\big(\\sum_{x}{\\frac{\\pi_x}{Q_{yx}} \\epsilon_x^2}\\big) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we want to compare a squared sum of products to a product of two sums... this looks like a job for the good old **[Cauchy-Schwartz inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality)**! And indeed, observing that $\\pi_x \\epsilon_x = (\\sqrt{Q_{yx} \\pi_x})\\big(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_x}{Q_{yx}}} \\epsilon_x \\big)$, it is easily verified that the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality yields the desired result.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **You treated $I(Q)$ as a function of $|X||Y|$ unconstrained variables, whereas it's really defined on an $|X|(|Y| - 1)$-dimensional polytope, because of the constraints on the columns sums.**\n",

    "\n",
    "> **To differentiate, you have assumed that $Q_{yx}$ is non-zero.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed; we prove the convexity of $I$ to the (dense, open and convex) subset of $Q$s where that's true, and can then conclude $I$ is convex on its entire domain using a continuity argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **To differentiate, you have assumed that $\\rho_y$ is non-zero.**\n",
    "\n",
    "True; however, observe that this assumption is valid provided that all $Q_{yx}$ are non-zero."
